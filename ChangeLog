ChangeLog
---------

Version 2022.01.00-a3 - ?-???-2022:
  - Added serial port support, e.g.
        OPEN "/dev/ttyS0: 115200" As #1
    this is very preliminary and in need of extensive user testing,
    see README for details.
  - Added XMODEM {SEND|RECEIVE} file$, #fnbr command:
    - #fnbr must first have been OPENed as a serial port.
    - unlike other MMBasic versions, MMB4L cannot use XMODEM to send to or
      receive from the console.
  - Added OPTION CODEPAGE page$ command:
    - causes character bytes in the range 128-255 to be translated to Unicode
      (UTF-8) when printed to the console according to a given code page /
      mapping.
    - supported values of page$ are currently:
      - "NONE"   : no mapping, characters 128-255 are written as-is.
      - "CMM2"   : best effort mapping to the characters of the CMM2 font.
      - "CP437"  : characters 128-255 of the original IBM PC code 437.
                   Note this was a non-ANSI code page which also included
                   characters 1-31 which are not available in this mapping,
                   but see "MMB4L".
      - "CP1252" : the classic Windows-1252 Latin alphabet code page.
      - "MMB4L"  : as "CP437" but with characters 129-159 replaced by the
                   original non-ANSI CP437 characters 1-31 and with additional
                   "useful" characters in positions 128, 161-170 and 255.
  - Added CHR$(UTF8 codepoint%) function:
    - given a Unicode code-point this returns the 1-4 character string encoding
      that character in UTF-8 format.
    - printing such characters is not compatible with OPTION CODEPAGE being
      set.
  - Added AUTOSAVE file$ command:
    - note that as with the CMM2 there is no CRUNCH option; AUTOSAVE writes to a
      file and MMB4L always crunches the program automatically when it loads it
      for execution.
  - Added CONSOLE SETSIZE [ATLEAST] width%, height% command:
    - sends an XTerm control sequence to set the terminal size.
    - if the optional ATLEAST modifier is used then this will not reduce the
      terminal width or height.
  - Added PRINT @(x%, y%) expression:
    - unlike the CMM2, x% & y% are obligatory and in character coordinates,
      there is no mode parameter.
    - equivalent to:
        CONSOLE SETCURSOR x, y : PRINT expression
  - Added missing LIST FILES command:
    - just another synonym for FILES and LS and only present for compatibility
      with the CMM2.
  - Changed SYSTEM command to allow standard output to be captured in a STRING
    (as an alternative to existing functionality to capture it in a LONGSTRING),
    e.g.
        DIM out$
        SYSTEM "echo `date`", out$
        PRINT out$
    Also any trailing whitespace, including CRLF is now trimmed from the
    captured STRING or LONGSTRING output.
  - Changed EOF() function to return 1 when at the end of file (like the CMM2),
    previously it returned -1.
  - Fixed bug so that MEMORY COPY command correctly handles overlapping source
    and destination.
  - Fixed bug with MM.INFO$(...) not being recognised in interactive mode:
    - synonym for MM.INFO(...).
    - interim fix pending rewrite of pre-processor and its use from interactive
      mode.
  - Fixed bug where error messages over 127 characters would overflow into
    the storage for MM.CMDLINE$
    - error messages are now truncated to 127 characters.

Version 2021.01.00-a2 - 6-Nov-2021:
  - Added ability to specify at the Linux shell a BASIC program that MMB4L
    should RUN when it starts, e.g.
        ./mmbasic myprogram.bas arg1 arg2 arg3
    see README for details.
  - Added optional integer argument (default 0) to END and QUIT that can be
    used to return an exit code to the Linux shell, see README for details.
  - Added SETTICK command from the CMM2:
    - SETTICK FAST is not supported.
    - Be aware that Since Linux is not a Real Time Operating System all timing
      commands such as PAUSE and SETTICK are subject to more error and variation
      than on the microcontroller MMBasic implementations.
  - Added JSON$() function from the CMM2:
    - MMB4L adds an optional 3rd parameter which is a 2 bit argument controlling
      how explicit nulls and missing values are handled in the JSON:
        - &b00 : return empty strings for both.
        - &b01 : return "<null>" for explicit null.
        - &b10 : return "<missing>" for missing value.
        - &b11 : return both "<null>" and "<missing>".
  - Added DAY$(), DATETIME$() and EPOCH() functions from the CMM2:
    - note that unlike DATE$ and TIME$ the DATETIME$(NOW) function will return
      the date & time in UTC, not in the local timezone.
  - Added missing MEMORY, PEEK and POKE sub-commands.
    Now implements the same as the CMM2 (5.07.01) with the exception of the
    undocumented/legacy:
        PEEK(hiaddr, loaddr)
        POKE hiaddr, loaddr, byte
    And with the addition of:
        MEMORY COPY BYTE src, dst, number_of_bytes
          - which is equivalent to MEMORY COPY src, dst, number_of_bytes
        MEMORY COPY SHORT src, dst, number_of_shorts
        MEMORY COPY WORD src, dst, number_of_words
  - Added optional integer array parameter to SYSTEM command to allow any
    standard output generated to be captured in a LONGSTRING, e.g.
        DIM out%(100)
        SYSTEM "ls", out%()
        LONGSTRING PRINT out%()
  - Added support for prefixing paths with '~' which is expanded to the
    users home directory (the value of the HOME environment variable).
  - Added optional integer argument (default 1) to ERROR command allowing an
    error code to be specified, this can be retrieved using MM.ERRNO, e.g.
        ERROR "error message", 220
    For MMB4L the values of MM.ERRNO are:
      - 0        : no error.
      - 1        : unclassified MMBasic error, also reported if a C library call
                   reports the error EPERM (Operation not permitted).
                   Note this differs from other versions of MMBasic which use
                   the value of 16 for general errors, this would correspond to
                   the EBUSY (Device or resource busy) error from a C library
                   call.
      - 2..150   : standard error numbers (errno) for C library calls.
      - 151..200 : reserved for future classification of MMBasic errors.
      - 201..255 : suggested range for program specific error codes.
      - error codes from the SYSTEM command are an exception to this rule,
        see the next entry.
  - Changed SYSTEM command to set MM.ERRNO equal to the executed program's
    exit code. Also changed error message to include this value.
  - Changed CONSOLE SETCURSOR command to allow a maximum x, y of 1023
    (previously 255) and updated "examples/mandelbrot.bas" to support this.
  - Changed "mmbasic.nanorc" to make behaviour more like the CMM2 editor:
      - added 'set constantshow' so the cursor position display is always
        visible.
      - added 'set zap' so that [Delete] and [Backspace] erase all the selected
        text instead of just a single character.
      - either of these can be commented out with # if you prefer.
  - Fixed issues with "mmbasic.syntax.nanorc":
      - command keywords always highlighted, not just when they are the first
        token on a line.
      - hexadecimal and binary constants highlighted as numbers (green).
      - comments correctly highlighted following string constants containing
        apostrophes.
      - highlighting of additional keywords.
  - Fixed timeout bugs with CONSOLE GETCURSOR:
      - increase the timeout to 10s.
      - correct the signed 64-bit arithmetic used in timing code.
  - Fixed bug where navigating the command prompt history with up/down arrow
    keys would show display artifacts when using PuTTY; though not sure why
    the issue was not generally visible.
  - Many other fixes and tweaks for minor issues encountered along the way.

Version 2021.01.00-a1 - 23-Sep-2021:
  - First alpha version.
